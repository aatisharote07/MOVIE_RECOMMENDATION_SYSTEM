# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System


Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System!

Built as a part of our academic mini-project, this system suggests movies similar to your favorites, using smart Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. 🚀

📌 Project Highlights

•	Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies purely based on metadata like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.

•	NLP Techniques: Tokenization, stemming, and vectorization using the Bag-of-Words model.

•	Cosine Similarity: Measures how close two movies are, based on their feature vectors.

•	Interactive Web App: Simple and elegant frontend using Flask and TailwindCSS.

•	Dynamic Movie Posters: Fetches real-time posters from TMDB API.

•	Top 10 Recommendations: Displays the top 10 similar movies for any selected title.

🛠️ Tech Stack

•	Python 3.7+

•	Flask (for backend)

•	HTML + Tailwind CSS (for frontend)

•	Pickle (for serialized models)

•	Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy (for data processing and ML)

•	TMDB API (for fetching movie posters)
